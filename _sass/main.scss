// base
// the base directory contains Sass files that start a page.
// These files are typically things like any vendor dependencies (Compass, Foundation)
// or any of our own authored dependencies (mixens, variables, extends).
// In the base directory we will also reset a default style for the browser.
@import "base/mixins";
@import "base/variables";
@import "base/extends";
@import "base/reset";

// layout
// the layout directory is a good place for us to control our grid system and any large page specific layout styles.
@import "layout/grid";

// modules
// the modules directory contains the majority of our files
// because we like to break our styles into small components
// so we can leverage them throughout multiple pages on our site.
// Each page is typically made up of at least 5 modules.
// Some of the more common modules will include items such as header, footer, navigation and content blocks.
@import "modules/header";
@import "modules/buttons";
@import "modules/footer";

// themes
// the themes directory contains any specific styles
// that a page may need to overwrite a style in the layout or modules
// without having to effect other pages referencing these layouts or modules.
// For example the header in your website maybe green throughout a website or application
// but on a specific page we want it to change to a grey background, thatâ€™s where the themes files come in handy.
